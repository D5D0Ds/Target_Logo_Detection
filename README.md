# Instructions to run the Notebook successfully.

- ***It is important to run the notebook in colab to execute file management as expected. However, the code can be modified accordingly to run on local machine using dedicated GPU.***

1. Run/Execute first 5 code cells of the notebook.
2. ***Important***⚠️ Before running the sixth cell of code, Navigate to files section made with 📁 button in left section of colab and go to datasets/Target-Logo-with-label-5/ --> Create new folder inside Target-Logo-with-label-5 and name it "valid" and upload images from the images folder.

**Note that you can upload your own images that you wish to test as well but it should only be in *.jpg format only else you might need to slightly change 9th cell of the code in Notebook accordingly.**

3. Once the images upload successfully in the folder run all the cells and the results will start showing up. 

4. Last cell provides the trained model for external usage.

I have attached the trained model, images to validate results, Notebook as well as training dataset as zip file in this zip.

🔼Please refer reading cells of the Jupyter Notebook for detailed explanation of the code with my approach and follow ups. 

Feel free to connect/contact me in case of any query. I will respond as soon as possible.

The code is also uploaded in github on [https://github.com/D5D0Ds/Target_Logo_Detection](https://github.com/D5D0Ds/Target_Logo_Detection).
